              <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
              <p>
                Hello world, my name is Mikhael Gonzalez. I'm the first born American in my family.
                My heritage is a mix of my Colombian and Venezuelan roots. My favorite thing I like
                to eat from my culture is Empanadas, a fried type of dough folded into a half moon
                and filled with anything from meats to cheese and whatever else you desire.
                Since they can be filled with anything sometimes I would imagine they have personality.
              </p>

              <p>
                Aside from food I like to play soccer, snowboard in the winter, and windsurf in warmer climate.
                I also like to read and draw avidly. All of these activities help me relax and manage my stress levels.
                My passion is in Mathematics and Computer Science, specifically coding. My first language I learned was
                C++ and it was a challenge to learn. Regardless of that, I stood with the class and continued into college
                learning Computer Science.
              </p>

              <p>
                Started my college career in SUNY University at Buffalo, after graduating from Francis Lewis High School in 2015.
                I completed my freshmen year and then transferred to CUNY LaGuardia Community College, completing my Associates of
                Science in Computer Science in December 2018. Currently I'm a trainee in LaGuardia Community College's TechHire
                program, funded by the Department of Labor and TechHire Intiative.
